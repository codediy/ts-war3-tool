<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>

<p><strong>Comments</strong>

<p>JASS Comments are identical to C++ and Java style line comments. Any
text following a <code>//</code> is ignored until the end of the line.
For example,

<pre class="source">
<span class="comment">// This is a comment</span>
<span class="keyword">function</span> my_function <span class="keyword">takes</span> <span class="type">nothing</span> <span class="keyword">returns</span> <span class="type">nothing</span> <span class="comment">// This is a comment</span>
<span class="keyword">     local</span> <span class="type">integer</span> foo <span class="comment">// This is a comment</span>
     <span class="comment">// This is a comment</span>
<span class="keyword">     set</span> foo = 10 <span class="comment">// This is a comment</span>
<span class="keyword">endfunction</span>
</pre>

<p><strong>White Space</strong>

<p>Except for newlines, all whitespace is ignored. In other words, the
level of indentation of declarations and statements and number of spaces/tabs
between words is irrelevant. 
In addition, extra newlines are allowed anywhere (i.e., you can have empty
blank lines).

<p>However, each function signature and statement must span only one line. 
There is no way to continue a statement on a second line. This may have
been violated in some places in this manual to make code more readable, but
should be maintained if you want a correct script.
